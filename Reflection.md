One of the main challenges I encountered was ensuring the data's integrity and cleanliness. Dealing with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies required careful attention and a methodical data preprocessing approach. This phase highlighted the importance of data preparation as a fundamental step to achieve accurate analysis.

Another significant obstacle arose when I designed and implemented JOIN and aggregation operations. While these operations are crucial, I realized that selecting the right attributes for JOIN and choosing appropriate aggregation measures demands a deep understanding of the data and its context. This insight emphasized the significance of conducting thorough data exploration and leveraging domain knowledge to create effective transformations.

Upon reflection, I recognize certain aspects I would approach differently in future projects. Particularly, I would allocate more time initially for comprehensive data exploration before diving into transformations. By gaining a better understanding of the datasets and their intricacies, I believe I could make more informed decisions about the specific JOIN and aggregation strategies that would yield the most valuable insights.

In conclusion, this project provided an invaluable learning experience that significantly improved my skills in data manipulation, transformation, and the practical implementation of database operations using Pyth
