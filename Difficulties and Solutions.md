Initially, I assessed the dataset's cleanliness and verified that it was indeed clean. Nevertheless, the presence of a common column named "carID" in both datasets caused a complication during the merging process. Attempting to merge them using the carID column resulted in syntax errors. To resolve this, I sought help from Google, which led me to discover the correct approach: using the "on=" function to merge datasets with a shared column. Eventually, by specifying "on = 'carID'," I successfully combined the two datasets.
